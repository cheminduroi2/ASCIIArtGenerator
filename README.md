# ASCII Art Generator

As a little exercise, I decided that I would build each project (except for the last) in the article [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/), using a different language for each project. This is the 1<sup>st</sup> project in the article, built in Node.js.
##### Project 1
##### [Project 2](https://github.com/cheminduroi/GameOfLife)

##### [Project 4](https://github.com/cheminduroi/PhotoMosaics)
##### [Project 5](https://github.com/cheminduroi/snake)
